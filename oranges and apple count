Ram's house has an apple tree and an orange tree. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where s is the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point a, and the orange tree is at point b.When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value of d means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and a positive value of d means it falls d units to the tree's right. Given the value of d for 3 apples and 3 oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Ram's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t]?
